This project’s intention is to create a setting that allows the user to participate in a playful engagement with the environment, promoting the use of the whole body as an input method. The player can form part of the screen, interacting and changing the movement of the falling shapes. The aim is to bump the shapes into the openings on each side of the screen, exploring and challenging the body’s movement in different ways. They will need to analyze their motions in a strategic way in order to manipulate the shapes as needed.
